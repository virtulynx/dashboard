## Getting Started

- In order to run the app, you will need to update the configuration file by adding the:

  - [Ad Account ID and User Access Token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens/)
  - [Facebook Page ID and Access Token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/access-tokens)

### Prerequisites

- If running locally:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which you can install via Homebrew (MacOS only) - `brew install node`
- If running in dev container:

  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or another environment that supports dev containers e.g. [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

- **You will need to have a Facebook Page / Ad account and an App created in Meta Developers**. If you donâ€™t have an app, follow the guide [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/) to create your app first.
